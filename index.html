            The amount of data generated grows exponentially every year, such that in late 2013 it was estimated that 90% of world's data had been generated over the previous two years; companies faces an arm-race to make sense of this flood of information, which can easily make the difference between understanding the market or going out of business.

          Either if you need to develop charts on your own or if you are a company that offers in data-visualization as a service, you'll need to build your work upon a chart library - and hopefully a good one too.

            <h1>An Overview of Visualization Libraries</h1>
            <h2>
              There are a few good, open source chart libraries out there that helps developers integrating charts and visualization solutions in web applications.
            </h2>
            <h2>Most of them are based on imperative programming, almost all of them uses SVG over HTML5: let's see which and why</h2>
            </h2>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="slide" id="slide_3_2" data-anchor="slide_3_2">
          <p>Among the vast offer of libraries for data visualization, the first big distinction can be made between HTML5 libraries and SVG libraries.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>HTML5</b> solutions uses the Canvas object, introduced in HTML5, to draw the shapes (or images) in the chart.</li>
            <li><b>SVG</b> solutions uses the Scalable Vector Graphic format, a markup language derived from XML that is supported by all browsers. Current version is 1.1 (technically 1.2, but no new features were introduced), but version 2 of SVG specifications is about to be released. </li>
          </ul> 
          <p>SVG and HTML5 solutions, as you would expect, have some Pros and Cons; oversimplyfying we could say that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SVG is a vector-based format, which means each drawn shape is an actual object added to the DOM. This means that the same shape or complex drawing can be ported to different devices and screen sizes without any noticeable loss of quality; also, being each shape an object of its own, if an attribute of an SVG object is changed, the browser can automatically update the view by re-rendering the corresponding node.
            </li>
            <li>Canvas is raster-based, so resizing the image created will produce pixelation or loss of details, and to reposition or change color to a shape, the whole scene needs to be redrawn. (However, layers can be created, such that only the layer containing a particular object needs to be redrawn)
            </li>
            <li>While it is possible to add an event listener to SVG elements, for Canvas shapes it is not: the behaviour of mouse clicks, for example, must be associated with single pixels on the canvas rather than shapes.
            </li>
            <li>On the other hand, when lots of elements are drawn to a SVG chart, every one of them is added to the DOM, even if it is not visible. In charts with tens of thousands elements shown, SVG solutions don't scale well.
            </li>
            <li>Also, Canvas are great to draw raster images and creates sprites, while in SVG it is simply not possible.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All things considered, since rarely you do need to insert more than a few hundreds shapes in a single chart (and if you do you might want to revisit yur design), so far SVG has been the mainstream technology for data visualization.</p>

        <div class="slide" id="slide_3_3" data-anchor="slide_3_3">
          <h3>HTML5 solutions</h3>
          <p>
          Probably the most famous example of a chart library using this solution is <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/">ChartJs</a>.
          <br>Another interesting library to manipulate shapes in the Canvas is <a href="http://fabricjs.com/"/>FabricJs.

            <h1>Using PathsJs in conjunction with RactveJS, it is possible to easily define reactive chart templates directly in the HTML page, bind data and define their behavior (dynamically) in JavaScript, thus obtaining a real MVC-compliant framework; Ractive, moreover, also takes care of animations <i>for free</i>, from a developer perspective.</h1>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="slide" id="slide_5_2" data-anchor="slide_5_2">
          <div class="intro">
Moreover, frameworks like [RactiveJs](http://www.ractivejs.org/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) are not just meant to let you inject code in your views. They heavily use template based models for presentation to allow you binding event handlers, data and even presentation logic directly inside the DOM elements, and then specify the details of these logic in separate scripts. Basically, it's the same principle used by JsAction for event handlers names (assigned as attributes in the markup) and handlers implementations (specified in js files/scripts). All in all, they rather increase separation between presentation and logic by enforcing the application of the [MVC pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller) to an higher degree, and at the same time they allow a very convenient use of templates.

These frameworks controls much more than event handling: they allow data-binding, which starts to be important when you care for model-view-control separation; they let you bind parts of the view to JavaScript objects, updating it every time the object behind it is modified. Moreover, they update views in particularly efficient ways, modifying only the smallest nodes affected by the change, and so limiting page repainting, since that would be a  bottleneck in most webapps.
To this end, Ractive and React uses a virtual DOM: an abstract representation of the DOM that allows for very fast operations by minimizing the amount of DOM manipulation that needs to take place.

Ractive and React are very similar to each other (besides the name!), both focusing on _reactive programming_ and visualization, while Angular is not just focused on the view part of MVC, it is a more complex framework, a heavier solution that, at the same time, handles routing, connection to the server etc...

All the frameworks mentioned above, moreover, support [two-way binding](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding): a very convenient way to enforce consistency between values in the DOM (typically the value of some input field) and some state in the application logic. A couple of examples should help you understanding why they are so convenient; I'll present these example using Ractive, but I encourage you to try and write the same solutions using React or (as much as possible) Angular.
